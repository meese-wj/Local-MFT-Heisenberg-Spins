# Local Mean Field Theory for a Heisenberg Chain

This repo contains a toy code that uses fixed-point iteration to obtain a mean-field solution to a 2d Heisenberg model.
The mean-field value of each spin is obtained per site using this approach on a 2d square lattice which is periodic in
the y-direction but has fixed boundaries in the x-direction.
